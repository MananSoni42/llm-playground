# LLM Playground

A collection of interactive applications built to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Projects

### Structura
**Tame the AI, get perfect structure:** A tool to connect with any LLM, define your desired output schema, and get perfectly structured results every time—no matter the task.

### Structura Bulk
**LLM power, spreadsheet speed:** Process entire CSV files of prompts in one go. Feed it your data, run it through your chosen LLM, and get structured outputs for every row—fast and consistent.

### Storybound
**Step into story — talk to the cast:** Interact with characters that remember events and relationships from their books, useful for roleplay, teaching, or writing sparring partners.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd llm-playground
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Configure your API Key:**
    Click the gear icon in the top left corner to add your API key from providers like Google, Anthropic, or OpenAI. This is required for the applications to function.

## Background

These projects originally started as Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. They have since been ported to this interactive web format. The website was completely vibe-coded using the Gemini CLI.
